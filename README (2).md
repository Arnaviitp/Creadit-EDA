# Credit Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a credit dataset. 
The analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from the data, assisting in better understanding the factors influencing credit decisions.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to analyze a dataset containing credit-related information. The analysis includes:

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- Summary Statistics  
- Visualization of key features  
- Identification of potential correlations and insights  

## Files in the Repository

- **Credit EDA.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the step-by-step analysis of the credit dataset.  
- **Dataset**: Ensure the dataset file is in the same directory or linked correctly for the notebook to function.

## Installation and Requirements

### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.7 or above  
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab  

### Python Libraries  
Install the required libraries using the following command:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**`requirements.txt`**:
```text
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-data-analysis.git
   cd credit-data-analysis
   ```
2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Credit EDA.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells step by step to reproduce the analysis.

## Key Features of the Notebook

- **Data Overview**: Understand the structure, dimensions, and types of data in the dataset.  
- **Handling Missing Values**: Strategies to impute or remove missing data points.  
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Generate summary statistics for numerical and categorical columns.  
- **Data Visualizations**: Visual analysis using histograms, box plots, heatmaps, etc.  
- **Insights & Findings**: Interpretation of the analysis to provide actionable insights.

## Future Work

- Implement machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Enhance visualizations with advanced libraries like `Plotly`.
- Explore feature engineering techniques for improving model performance.
